# Smart Deployer

Smart Deployer is a universal solution for organizing and managing paid smart contract deployments.

🧾 Every contract in this repository is fully documented using NatSpec — including deployment instructions, configuration details, and extensibility tips. Following best practices and released under the MIT license, allows developers to:

- Deploy your own `DeployManager.sol`
- Create & connect utility contracts using template
- Monetize the deployment of utility contracts
- Enable\disable contracts, fees any time
